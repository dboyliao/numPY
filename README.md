# `numPY`: A pure python implementation of `numpy` array

It's a project for me to test my understanding of multidimension array in python.

It's not going to have any pratical use, just for educational purpose.

## Roadmap

[v] multidimensional array constructor
[v] basic slicing (shared memory view)
[v] advanced slicing (copy)
[] fancy `__setitem__`
[] pretty `__repr__`
